# DS400-Capstone
Repository for my final data science capstone project 

This projects goal is to take MLB (Major League Baseball) Data from 2010-2022 and create predictions surrounding an advanced baseball statistic called WAR (Wins Above Replacement)
This will hopefully allow newer baseball fans to learn about different statistics and how they attribute to a teams performance.

Final Project Code.zip contains all the files containing the data cleaning, EDA, models, and application, as well as an explanation of them and how to use.
